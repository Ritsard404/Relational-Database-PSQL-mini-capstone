# Relational-Database-PSQL-mini-capstone
Sunvoltage Corporation Management System 

I created this project as part of my second-year coursework in Database Management System, employing Python with PYQT6.
The application is designed around a Relational Database, specifically PostgreSQL.
While the code may not be perfectly organized at this stage, as it represents my initial attempt at developing a desktop application, I am actively learning and refining my programming skills.
